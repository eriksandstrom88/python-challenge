PyBank and PyPoll homework for DU Data Analytics Bootcamp

In the PyBank Challenge I opened and iterated through a .csv to find the total months of profit and loss tracked, the total profit over those months, the month-to-month change in profit and loss, and the dates and amounts of the greatest increase and decrease in change of profit/loss.  I had to complete the entire exercise using python code, which I wrote in Visual Studio, and executed in the GitBash Terminal.

For the PyPoll Challenge, I opened and iterated through another .csv to find the total number of votes cast, the number of unique candidates receiving votes, the number of votes each candidate received, the percentave of votes each candidate received, and I determined the winner by ranking the vote totals.  Again, this was done entirely in python scripts written in Visual Studio and executed in the GitBash Terminal.
